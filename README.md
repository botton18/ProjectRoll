Automatic Toilet Paper Dispenser 

By Justin Kan, Calvin Lu, Joey Truong, Dillon Sio, and Aaron Reyes

Our team designed an auto-loading toilet paper dispenser capable of accepting toilet paper rolls in storage and automatically replacing new rolls with the press of a button.

This programs in the repository require Alduino IDE to test and run the files. This project includes hardware for testing purposes. Tools and kits used include Arduino 101, push-pull solenoids, breadboards, and various tools in order for the demo to work.
